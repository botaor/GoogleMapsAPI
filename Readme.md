# Google Maps API Sample


## What it is
An html page that shows the various capabilities of the Google Maps API. It is also used as a testing ground for ideas to be used on real world projects.


## Usage
Just load the HTML page in a browser capable of handling HTML5. Any modern browser should work fine.

Testing is done in Chrome and Fire Fox.

So as not to expose my Google Maps API key, you have to give your key in the URL. Here is an example:

	test.html?key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx


## Dependencies
This project uses [JQuery][jquery].

To show the map markers in clusters we use the library [js-marker-clusterer][cluster_lib].


## Authors
Developed by [Rui Botão][rui].


## Licensing
This project is released under the terms of the [MIT license][mit].

The short version: just use it!


## Bibliography
